/*LeetCode Problem 30: Substring with Concatenation of All Words.
Letâ€™s go step by step so you understand it deeply, not just get the code.

ðŸ“„ Problem Statement
Youâ€™re given:

A string s

A list of words words, all the same length

You need to:

Find all starting indices of substrings in s that are a concatenation of each word exactly once, in any order, without extra characters.*/

/*Input:
s = "barfoothefoobarman"
words = ["foo","bar"]

Output: [0, 9]

Explanation:
- "barfoo" starting at 0
- "foobar" starting at 9
*/

/*Input:
s = "wordgoodgoodgoodbestword"
words = ["word","good","best","word"]

Output: []
*/
